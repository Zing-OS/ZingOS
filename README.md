## Why use ZingOS?

Zing is a modified version of Windows created with peformance, privacy and security in mind. Default Windows comes with many components, features and settings that can cause a significant decrease in peformance. Zing removes those components which decrease peformance to increase the overall peformance of your system and decrease latency. Zing is also more secure and private due to the removal of the majority of telementry and features that may pose a risk to security.

Zing is also easier to install and get up and running due to our Post-Install script which allows you to download the software you need at the click of a button saving you time and effort. Zing is also open source which means you can build Zing from source and you can see everything that goes into Zing.
