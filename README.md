## Why use ZingOS?

Zing is a modified version of Windows created with peformance, privacy and security in mind. Default Windows comes with many components, features and settings that can cause a significant decrease in peformance. Zing removes those components which decrease peformance to increase the overall peformance of your system. Zing is also more secure and private due to the removal of the majority of telementry and features that may pose a risk to security.
